## Usage of Kaggle API
This project uses Kaggle API to download the dataset. Ensure you have Python 3 and the package manager `pip` installed.

### Installation

If the API is not already installed, run the following command to access the Kaggle API using the command line:

`pip install kaggle` (You may need to do `pip install --user kaggle` on Mac/Linux.  This is recommended if problems come up during the installation process.) Installations done through the root user (i.e. `sudo pip install kaggle`) will not work correctly unless you understand what you're doing.  Even then, they still might not work.  User installs are strongly recommended in the case of permissions errors.

If you run into a `kaggle: command not found` error, ensure that your python binaries are on your path.  You can see where `kaggle` is installed by doing `pip uninstall kaggle` and seeing where the binary is.  For a local user install on Linux, the default location is `~/.local/bin`.  On Windows, the default location is `$PYTHON_HOME/Scripts`.

### API credentials

To use the Kaggle API, sign up for a Kaggle account at https://www.kaggle.com. Then go to the 'Account' tab of your user profile (`https://www.kaggle.com/<username>/account`) and select 'Create API Token'. This will trigger the download of `kaggle.json`, a file containing your API credentials. Place this file in the location `~/.kaggle/kaggle.json` (on Windows in the location `C:\Users\<Windows-username>\.kaggle\kaggle.json` - you can check the exact location, sans drive, with `echo %HOMEPATH%`). You can define a shell environment variable `KAGGLE_CONFIG_DIR` to change this location to `$KAGGLE_CONFIG_DIR/kaggle.json` (on Windows it will be `%KAGGLE_CONFIG_DIR%\kaggle.json`).

For your security, ensure that other users of your computer do not have read access to your credentials. On Unix-based systems you can do this with the following command: 

`chmod 600 ~/.kaggle/kaggle.json`
